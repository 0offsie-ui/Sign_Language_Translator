                    <h2>What is Sign Language?</h2>
                    <p><strong>Sign Language</strong> is a language that uses visual gestures and signs, as opposed to vocal communication, to convey meaning. It is primarily used by the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities, but is also utilized by individuals with speech or language impairments. Sign language is not universal; different regions have their own systems, such as American Sign Language (ASL), British Sign Language (BSL), and Filipino Sign Language (FSL).</p>

It allows for the expression of thoughts, feelings, and ideas, enabling deaf individuals to engage with others, participate in society, and access education and employment opportunities.</p>

                    <p>The history of sign language dates back to ancient times, with evidence of hand gestures being used in early civilizations. However, modern sign languages began to develop in the 18th and 19th centuries. One of the earliest schools for the deaf, the <i>French National Institute for Deaf-Mutes</i>, was founded by Charles-Michel de l’Épée, who helped establish the foundation for sign language.</p>
